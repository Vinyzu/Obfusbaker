# Obfusbaker v2.0
Obfusbaker is a Python Obfuscator.
It doesnt use exec() or eval() to run hashed/encrypted python code from strings.
It renames Variables, Functions and Builtins in misc. UniCode Chars to break an IDE/Code Editor.
It also encrypts strings in a custom encryption function, minifies the code and by default adds random indentations to further disable visibility for a potential code breaker.
You can also choose the maximum Protection Option, in which Obfusbaker obfuscates attribute names, by wrapping them inside setattr() and getattr() functions.

## Slowdowns
Because Obfusbaker messes with the Source Code and adds Protection algorithm, it produces slowdowns for your code.
The Example Times for a very calculation heavy task (N-Queens solver with dancing links) are:

|    Obfuscation Type   | Time for Execution | Slowdown by |
|:---------------------:|:------------------:|:-----------:|
|     No Obfuscation    | 0.4332432746887207 |     1x      |
|  Default Obfuscation  | 1.7924633026123047 |     4x      |
| No Indent Obfuscation | 1.2777245044708252 |     3x      |
|  Maximum Obfuscation  | 10.297466278076172 |     23x     |


Note that these times are measured on a very calculation heavy task.
For normal Python Scripts, you can expect the Slowdowns to be lower.


## Development

Development is not active. I only intend to update this project when needed.
